	//How to achieve Abstraction ?
	//There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java

	//Abstract class (0 to 100%)
	//Interface (Achieve 100% abstraction)
	//Difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction:
	//Encapsulation is not providing full security because we can access private member of the class using 
	//reflection API, but in case of Abstraction we can't access static, abstract data member of a class.
