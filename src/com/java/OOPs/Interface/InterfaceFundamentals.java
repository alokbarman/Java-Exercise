public class InterfaceFundamentals {
	
//Interface is similar to class which is collection of public static final variables (constants) and abstract methods.

//The interface is a mechanism to achieve fully abstraction in java. There can be only abstract methods in the interface.
	//It is used to achieve fully abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
	
	//Why we use Interface ?
	//It is used to achieve fully abstraction.
	//By using Interface, you can achieve multiple inheritance in java.
	//It can be used to achieve loose coupling.
	
	//How interface is different from class ?
	//You can not instantiate an interface.
	//It does not contain any constructors.
	//All methods in an interface are abstract.
	//Interface can not contain instance fields. Interface only contains public static final variables.
	//Interface is can not extended by a class; it is implemented by a class.
	//Interface can extend multiple interfaces. It means interface support multiple inheritance
	
	//When we use abstract and when Interface
	//If we do not know about any things about implementation just we have requirement specification then we 
	//should be go for Interface

	//If we are talking about implementation but not completely (partially implemented) then we should be go for 
	//abstract
